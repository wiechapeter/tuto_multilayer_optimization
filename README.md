# Optimization with `PyMoosh` and `Nevergrad`

Tutorial python notebooks, accompanying the paper *An illustrated tutorial on global optimization in nanophotonics* ([link](https://notyetthere)).

We demonstrate how to do global optimization of the geometry of multi-layered photonic structures. Multi-layer simulations are done with [`PyMoosh`](https://github.com/AnMoreau/PyMoosh), as optimization toolkit we use [`Nevergrad`](https://facebookresearch.github.io/nevergrad/).

## Goal of the example problems

**The tutorials have two main goals:**

  1. providing a simple introduction and a starting point for global optimization of multi-layer structures.
  
  2. demonstrating advanced benchmarking in order to find the best optimization algorithm for a specific problem and to assess the quality of the found solution.
  

**Three specific examples are treated:**

  1. optimization of a Bragg mirror
  
  2. Solving of an ellipsometry inverse problem
  
  3. design of a sophisticated antireflection coating to optimize solar absorption in a photovoltaic solar cell
